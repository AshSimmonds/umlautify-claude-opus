# umlautify-claude-opus  

From Kat:  

>I just did a search but could not find a tool that converts ae oe and ue to German umlauts throughout a whole bunch of text I just want to copy paste. That would be cool to have as a webtool with some ads on the side for income.  

Did zero coding myself, just explained what I wanted, and over a dozen or so prompts fine-tuned it.
